# BundleKit

BundleKit is a ThunderKit extension that adds advanced unity build file manipulation.  Build files include AssetBundles, Assets files, and resS files.

This tool is built with the AssetTools.NET library and ThunderKit to provide powerful tooling that can be integrated into any build workflow.
By taking advantage of advanced hidden features in Unity Assetbundles by using AssetTools.NET, BundleKit allows assets such as Materials and Prefabs to be added to Bundles.
When building bundles that depend on game assets, BundleKit provides tools to prevent those dependencies from being duplicated into your files, keeping them small and efficient.

BundleKit is in an extremely experimental state, and currently doesn't complete all functions required for this project.
